Static calibration is often conducted entirely within a controlled, indoor setting, using specialized tools and calibration targets placed at precise distances around the vehicle. During this process, the vehicle remains stationary as technicians use measurement tools to align sensors and cameras accurately. This controlled environment minimizes variables and allows for the exact positioning required, ensuring that ADAS components align perfectly with the system's intended parameters.

Dynamic calibration, on the other hand, involves driving the vehicle under specific conditions, usually on open roads or controlled testing areas. The process requires driving at designated speeds for a set distance to allow the ADAS sensors and cameras to self-adjust in real-time. Specialized tools interact with the ADAS system during the drive to ensure sensors recalibrate accurately in response to the surrounding environment. This method is beneficial because it adjusts ADAS systems based on the vehicle's actual movement, allowing for on-the-road sensor adjustments that a stationary environment may not capture.

Some vehicles require both methods, a process known as dual calibration, which combines static and dynamic approaches to achieve maximum accuracy. High-end vehicles or those equipped with particularly advanced ADAS features often require dual calibration to meet manufacturer standards. Dual calibration starts with static adjustments in a controlled environment, followed by dynamic recalibration on the road to refine the system’s alignment further. Each vehicle manufacturer specifies which calibration method is required for their models, as different ADAS designs have varying alignment needs.
